# sdim

## Project Overview

There are no readily available stabilizer circuit simulators for **qudits** (multi-level quantum systems). The two most prominent ones are [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq/build/qudits) qudit statevector simulation and [True-Q™](https://trueq.quantumbenchmark.com/index.html) closed source program.

Qudits are a growing research interest as an alternative way to scale certain quantum architectures. 

The following are relevant details for the project:
- Has support for **only Clifford** operations. 
- **Prime** dimensions are strongly tested while the "fast" solver for composite dimensions is known to have possible errors
    - The issue lies in math implementation details that can be found inside the markdown located in `sdim/tableau`
- Does not currently `.stim` circuit notation, only a variant based on Scott Aaronson's original `.chp`

## Project Installation
Simply `git clone` the project and run `pip install -e .` to install the `sdim` python module.

## How to use sdim?
Take a look at the Python notebooks inside examples.
